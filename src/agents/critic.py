Review rules:
- Check if the original query is fully answered by the findings
- Check if any sub-questions are poorly covered or missing
- Identify specific missing topics, time periods, or perspectives
- Output ONLY a bulleted list of gaps, or output exactly: NO_GAPS if research is sufficient
- Be concise — max 3 gaps, each a single sentence
- Example output with gaps:
• Missing: recent post-2024 developments in the field
• Insufficient coverage of industrial applications
• No mention of regulatory or ethical challenges

Example output without gaps:
NO_GAPS
